# Functional PHP

## About

These are the slides for my presentation at DrupalCon Munich 2012: Multi-headed Drupal.

These slides are created using <a href="https://github.com/Seldaek/slippy">Slippy</a>
by Jordi Boggiano.  It's the HTML presentation system I find I dislike least.
Give it a try. :-)

Note that the CSS is controlled using Sass.  If the CSS isn't displaying properly
for you, try regenerating it.  Consult your favorite Sass reference. for more
information.
